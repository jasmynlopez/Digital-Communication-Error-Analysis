# Digital-Communication-Error-Analysis
### Error Analysis in Sound-based Digital Communication System

In this project, I analyze systematic error in 6 unique settings:
Without noise (simulated)
Without noise (physical)
With noise (clapping)
With noise (speaking)
With frequency domain filtering
With error correction (convolution encoding and viterbi decoding)

Methods, results, challenges, and conclusions can all be found in the .ipynb notebook
