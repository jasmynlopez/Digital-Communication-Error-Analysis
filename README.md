# Digital-Communication-Error-Analysis
### Error Analysis in Sound-based Digital Communication System

In this project, I analyze systematic error in 6 unique settings:
Without noise (simulated)
</br>
Without noise (physical)
</br>
With noise (clapping)
</br>
With noise (speaking)
</br>
With frequency domain filtering
</br>
With error correction (convolution encoding and viterbi decoding)
</br>

Methods, results, challenges, and conclusions can all be found in the .ipynb notebook
